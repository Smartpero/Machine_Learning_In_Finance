# Machine Learning in Finance

## Description

This repository contains coursework and projects exploring applications of **machine learning** in quantitative finance.  
It includes Jupyter notebooks, project tasks, and reports that cover topics such as predictive modeling, feature engineering, model evaluation, and financial forecasting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Smartpero/Machine_Learning_In_Finance.git
   cd Machine_Learning_In_Finance
2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies. A typical set might include:
   pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
4. Install rrequirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

- Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks (e.g. Notebook 1.ipynb, Notebook 2.ipynb, etc.) to explore machine learning models applied to financial datasets.

- Follow the project tasks in the respective PDFs for guided exercises.

- Review project reports for conclusions and findings.

- Use the notebooks for hands-on experiments: try new feature sets, tune model hyperparameters, compare models, visualize results.

## Features

- Multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different ML techniques in finance (regression, classification, time-series forecasting, etc.)

- Project task descriptions that guide applied work and learning

- Project reports summarizing results, insights, and model evaluation

- Visualizations of model performance, error metrics, and financial data features

- Emphasis on comparing different algorithms and validating models
## Configuration
- Setting	            :                Description
- Python environment	   :             Ensure correct Python version (e.g. 3.8+) and virtual environment activation
- Dependencies	          :            Required libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Notebook paths	       :             Notebooks expect certain directory structure; keep relative paths consistent for data/assets if used
- Dataset / data sources	 :           If using external or custom datasets, ensure proper file placement or update paths inside notebooks
- Model/Hyperparameter settings	   :   Notebooks may have tunable settings for model type, hyperparameters, feature sets â€” adjust as needed for experiments
